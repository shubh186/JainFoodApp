"Jain Bites" - Mobile Application Project
********************************************************************************
- Collaborated on a team-based project to build and launch an interactive mobile application that caters to users' vegetarian dietary needs, addressing the lack of "Jain" and vegetarian food options across the Greater Toronto Area (GTA).
- To enhance user convenience, the application integrates the Google Maps API, empowering users to explore a comprehensive list of cuisine options located near their current position. With over 10 distinct cuisine types to choose from,       users can easily filter and refine their restaurant preferences based on various criteria, including price, alphabetical order, ratings, vegetarian exclusivity, and cuisine type.
- Our application goes beyond basic listing functionality by providing detailed insights into each restaurant. Users can access information about vegetarian and Jain options available on the menu, along with valuable notes on specific       inquiries to make with the chef. Additionally, we incorporated a feature allowing users to directly input the restaurant's location into Google Maps with a simple click, streamlining the navigation process and have also provided an       option for the user to notify us of a restaurant that is currently not within our database, via a user input google form. 
- Since its launch, the application has gained significant traction, currently holding over 700 downloads between the Google Play Store and App Store.
